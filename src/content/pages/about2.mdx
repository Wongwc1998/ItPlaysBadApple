### _Anything that can display something will eventually have a Bad Apple!! port on it._

--Some Youtube comment

### TL;DR: &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; (Full name &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; ft. nomico) is a fan-made, black-and-white music video of a fan-made cover of a track in [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project), a series of [bullet hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell) video games. Due to the ardent fanbase of the Touhou Project, and the simplicity of the music video, the music video has been ported to countless platforms and devices. This website is a catalog for all things that can play the &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; video.

Originally, &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; is the 7th track in the soundtrack of the video game [Lotus Land Story](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story), the 4th entry of Touhou Project, a series of bullet hell video game developed by Japanese game developer, [ZUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZUN_(video_game_developer)), with a devoted following.

The track was covered by Masayoshi Minoshima, the leader of the music group [Alstroemeria Records](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Alstroemeria_Records), featuring the voice of singer nomico.

Later, a fan by the name of Mμ on the Japanese video website, Nico Nico Douga, outlined a story board for a music video for this track.

The music video for this track was created by the animator Anira(あにら). The music video featured the black-and-white silhouettes of the 3d models of the characters from the Touhou Project.

This video was then ported to various platforms by Touhou Project fans, including obscure hardware, such as old computers, oscilloscopes, anything with a display, or software, such as Minecraft, Task Manager, or anything with a display(again).

The music video is easily replicable, given that it is in black-and-white, and the silhouette of the character in the music video is very recognizable. In many ways Bad Apple!! is similar to the video game Doom, in that it is an elementary, yet charming and recognizable piece of art, that serves as a &quot;Hello World!&quot; for graphic display capabilities. This website thus serves as a catalog for all things that can play the &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; video.

Unfortunately this website does not play the &quot;Bad Apple!!&quot; video, YET. I need to figure out how to implement the Bad Apple CSS art across the website.
