Greetings, I am Dylan Wong, a full stack web developer from Hong Kong, currently living in Toronto, looking for a job. I love desiging websites and other tools to solve problems.

I enjoy reading books and watching films in my spare time. I am also very interested in AI technologies (like 50% of this site is generated with GPT-4). If you can&apos;t tell, I&apos;m also a huge fan of Touhou Project.

I'm mostly building this website as a part of my portfolio to increase my hiring chances.
