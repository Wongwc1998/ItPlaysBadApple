## Main inspirations:
- [Skateshop by Sadman.](https://skateshop.sadmn.com/) I literally copied the design of this site, and adjusted the code here and there to fit my needs.

- [Taxonomy by Shadcn.](https://taxonomy.shadcn.com/) I used the same stack as this site, and I also used the same design for the navbar.

- Last but not least, [ChatGPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/) for generating code, explaining where my code went wrong, and how other people's code works.

## Stack of this website:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/)
