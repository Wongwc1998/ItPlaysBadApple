It deserves to be more widely viewed! So, credit to Applesorce, and Kara for the song, and Num_Kadoma for what I assume is the Video programming.",

I can't take any credit for its creation but if it help bring a smile to y'all then I'm pleased.\r\n\r\n*EDIT: Less than a week, the video has nearly 200k views and featured on Cirno ⑨ News Network. To show my thanks, I added annotations translating the song with a few comments during the interlude and ending. I prefer to watch it w/o annotations first to appreciate the video first. Then watch it the second time reading the subs if you are interested in the song.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I last uploaded something from Nico Douga and this one caught my eye. Followers of the Touhou game franchise would recognize the source song and video \"Bad Apple!!\" by nomico as it maintained 7 solid weeks on top of the Nico Nico Douga weekly rankings.\r\n \r\nFor the record, I don't own the video.

Actual Bad Apple starts at 3:26. \n\nAccording to @Microcomputer12 , his system utilized fast and big 200 MB ATA HDD; but my goal was to do it on standard AT hardware without using anything that replace original hardware (the only exception was the replacement of discharged CMOS battery to 2 CR2032 connected in series; but it has no effect on performance, just trick to get back AT's ability to utilize RTC and keep CMOS data).\n\nTo do this, I had to deassemble the video to unique frames and sound and then recompile it using xdc_comp probing different parameters, and then transfer it to AT by network (as I don't have 5.25\" floppy drive on my main PC, but have TCP/IP stack for DOS).\nAbout third or fourth attempt - and now it works!\n\nIn addition I show a boot process of this AT (initializing XMS, network, keyboard/screen localizer (KeyRus), Sound Blaster, and starting Norton Commander). Well, some parts of software are Russian versions.\nAlso a little sup to the imageboard, where this idea was born - at the end.\n\nConfiguration:\n- IBM PC AT model 5170 S/N (?) 7327005\n- 3,5 MB RAM (512K onboard + 3072K on expansion board)\n- Seagate ST4038 31 MB Type 20 MFM HDD (733/5/17 geometry)\n- ATI EGA Wonder video card\n- Amptron Color EGA Monitor\n- Sound Blaster 16 (model CT2910)\n\nAlso were installed, but not used:\n- RTL8019 ISA Network Card\n- US Robotics Sportster 0460 ISA Modem\n- Microsoft InPort Mouse\n- 5,25\" Alps DFC642B01B 1.2MB FDD",

        "description": "Proof that Excel can do anything! (See below for details)\n\n東方Bad Apple PVをエクセル(Excel)で再現してみた\n\nDetails:\n----------------------\nPython was used to downsample the source video into a binary format containing display data. The data was then unpacked, frame by frame, into Excel using a VBA script.\n\nThis approach differs from traditional render-in-excel approaches, in that each frame is programmatically rendered onto the screen within a predefined area (the \"render window\"). Other approaches typically render all frames in a single worksheet and scan across the frames at a given frame rate. Although the traditional approach is faster and yields real-time video playback, the in-place method is interesting to consider because it consumes less application memory and leaves cells outside the render window unaffected. With this approach, one can imagine producing animated results for worksheet calculations in a way that doesn't affect the view of the current workspace.\n\nRender time was 0.45 seconds per frame (60x80 display), which is too slow for live video playback. Thus, the final result was sped up by 460% to create this video.\n\nThe blue highlight is a bug in Excel for Mac, and is an artifact of adjusting the global column heights and widths at the beginning of the script.\n----------------------\nSource Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkgK8eUdpAo\nOriginal: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm8628149",

Sadly my Powerpak cartridge no longer functions so I thought I'd do a version that was made for the first computer I owned way back in 1984, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. This actual ZX Spectrum is not an original, it's a \"Harlequin 128\" kit, which gives you the expanded ram and AY-3 soundchip that the 128 series computers had but in a form factor that fits into the original rubber key casing. But hold up! This isn't even an original case, it's a modern remake made from translucent plastic. It's very snazzy.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this video. I may make more for other systems in the future. Maybe in even less than ten years.\n\nFor this ZX Spectrum version, the coding was by Noby Noblnoch and music by Aki.

Mainly because all of these are done manually. Firstly I downloaded the original Bad Apple video then used mosaic to pixelate it to 16x12 pixels. Then I limit the color depth to 1bit so that no gray pixels are visible and converted it to 10 fps. Afterwards the frames of the video are extracted into 2100+ of images. Light bulbs act as pixels for the display and delay blocks act as frames. I overlay the frames using Sony Sketch to compare every frame and make changes to the light bulbs on the display.\n\nOriginal mv: https://youtu.be/i41KoE0iMYU\n\n#roblox #buildaboatfortreasure #badapple",

        "title": "Bad Apple but its VIDEO is ported to Famitracker",
        "description": "\"Bad Apple!!\" is originally the stage 3 theme from Touhou Gensoukyou: Lotus Land Story by ZUN,  but it is probably better known for the arrangement \"Bad Apple ft. Nomico\" by Alstroemeria Records and the shadow art video made for it. The audio is an original 8-bit remix by me, mostly based on the Alstroemeria Records arrangement, for 2A03 + VRC6 + MMC5 + 4-N163 + FDS + S5B.\n\nI've never used more than one expansion chip at a time before, but the project called for it; if I'm using 18 channels for the sake of cramming a video in there, it feels silly to not to have them play audio too. It also gave me a way to make my cover just a little bit different from many of the other covers already on YouTube (I went through dozens; only one was multichip and still used fewer chips than mine), when the need to sync my cover up with the visuals meant I couldn't alter the tempo or song structure at all. For this reason, I also decided to use the original melody in the second half.\n\nThere is one caveat worth mentioning: a song in Famitracker can only have 256 patterns. Since I'm using one pattern per frame, and way more than 256 frames, it was unavoidable to break it down into segments. For an uninterrupted viewing experience, I edited the segments together in post, and overlaid a raw export of the audio over it at the end. The whole thing easily fit into a single module, though.\n\nOne other minor thing is, because Famitracker centers the currently playing row, I had to make the Famitracker window very tall. The bottom was pretty much just empty space, though, so I cropped it out of the final video.\n\nThis module was made by using a Dxx effect to skip to the bottom row of each frame, which is where the actual musical commands are. Bad Apple ft. Nomico is at 138 BPM, and a [7,6] groove achieves an extremely close 138.46 BPM. This means the framerate is 9.6fps, which is not as high as I would have liked, but more wasn't really achievable. In theory, you can set the speed to 1 and achieve 60fps, but Famitracker simply isn't designed for video playback and therefore just won't render that many frames that fast—at least, not at the 160x120 resolution I'm using here.\n\nThis idea was inspired in part by pigdevil2010's port of Bad Apple to ImpulseTracker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDvk3aL78fI\n\nHere are the modules, for DN-Famitracker 0.5.0.0. One contains the audio only, and the other includes the video. They are not compatible with previous versions of DN-Famitracker, or previous Famitracker forks. The Python script I used to generate the video module from the audio module and a folder full of video stills is available as well.\n\nRepository with all files: https://github.com/wildmatsu/BadAppleFamitrackerConverter\nModule with Video and Audio: http://wildmatsu.xyz/fami/BadAppleVideo.zip\nModule with Audio Only: http://wildmatsu.xyz/fami/BadAppleAudio.dnm\nSource Code (Archive): http://wildmatsu.xyz/fami/BAFTConverter.zip\n\nListen on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/matsumuho/bad-apple",

Also don't mind the black bar at the bottom, I cropped it so that the original video wouldn't cover the keyboard but I was too lazy to crop the top of the video.\n\n\nP.S\nI probably should have tested some settings a bit more, because if I had changed the resolution to 24x7 instead of 24x6 the bottom row of the keyboard would also have been lit properly.

If you get problems with vertical deflection (impulses disappearing) then just increase the Rset resistor. In my case I went from 680k to 1M. 750k didn't work.\n\nSecond improvement is better contrast.\nCollector resistor increased in value, lower base resistor lowered in value. This increased the gain of Z axis.\n\nI cannot do as much due to screen burn.\nIf you actually decide to do this, please set the transistor gain to something like 10 or even more and adjust gain using some potentiometer. Less work and easier to adapt to devices with various signal levels.\n\nApart from mentioned changes the rest is the same.\nPlease refer to previous video for schematics etc.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVXF57_3mBY",

        "description": "I was wondering whether or not it would be possible to convert an FMV to a bunch of CSS animation statements and then use a basic HTML scaffold to play it. Turns out, you can*.\nI had to add the audio after the fact, as I had no way of reliably synchronize it with the animation...\n\n*Well... kinda. This is Bad Apple converted to CSS Animations. The video is split up into it's individual pixels at a set resolution, each pixel represented by a single CSS @keyframes tag. The HTML then plots these pixels in a grid predetermined in my script generating these files.\nI limited it to a resolution of 120x80 pixels and a maximum of 20 keyframes per second. Anything more and the resulting CSS would basically bring Firefox to crash. Seems like the hard limit for CSS file sizes (at least in the case of Firefox) seems to be 400MB xD\nI haven't tried Chrome much, as my first Attempt with the whole Video already made Chromium beg me to stop. It basically skipped the first 20-30 seconds of the video and instead of playing it at the intended 5 keyframes per second at 160x120 (what I tested at first), it rendered the animation at something closer to 1-2fps.\nFirefox came through and even played the 20 keyframes per second here at what seems like almost (if not actually) 20-30fps.\n\nThe smeary-ness at some points of the video comes down to the browser trying to render in-between frames to make the \"animations\" more smooth. I can't prevent this from happening.\n\nIf you want to play around with the tool I made for this, it's on GitHub: https://github.com/Chickenbreadlp/Seq_To_CSS\nIt can be used with basically any Image sequence, they will however be converted to Grayscale.\n\nYou can download the rendered HTML and CSS I used in this video here: https://mega.nz/file/T15gTYpD#Vi4CbvRVi73CEIL6O6p33JJ97TRTsYGVJDuUwAo6CWA\nI used the 15x Zoom, as that filled the screen the most on my 1440p monitor without cutting anything off.\n\nThe original PV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8",

You thought you could escape huh?\n89 segments here. \nPLEAE READ THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS BEFORE YELLING ABOUT COVERS\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- What about the apple/sheep/stopmotion version?\nI only chose covers that changed the audio, not just the video, so while there are several videos I wanted to use I unfortunately could not.\n- What about the one that describes the video?\nThat was released ONE day before my video! It could not have been included.\n- What about Cloudjumper?\nCouldn't use because copyright.\n- What about Nhato remix?\nI did a dumb thing and forgot to put it in, despite writing it down. My bad.\n- What about [INSERT NAME HERE] cover/remix?\nSorry, there was only a limited amount of space so I couldn't fit every cover in the world. Alas, I am restricted by reality.\n\nThis uses the five-minute version of Bad Apple by Alstroemeria Records, though some of the covers were the short version so there could be a little disconnect. It's kind of like the Bad Apple parade that I know exists somewhere but it's more switchy.\n\n\nBrief history of Bad Apple for those who don't know (I've got to fill this description somehow): Bad Apple originates from the game Touhou by ZUN. The theme was remixed by Alstroemeria Records. Touhou fans, being the ridiculously overpowered people they are, creating a black-and-white shadow art PV for the song containing characters from Touhou. It became ridiculous popular and became the first video to hit 10 million (and then 20 million) views on Nico Nico (basically YouTube but Japanese). It's still the most viewed video on Nico Nico today, I think. Alongside UN Owen Was Her and Night of Nights, it's one of the most well-known songs that originated from the Touhou project and has been hailed as the Megalovania of the 2000s (the Megalovania cover-switch version is, after all, what inspired this video). \n\nCredits are in the comments since they're over the description limit (as in the just the names and links were greater than 5,000 characters. This doesn't include all the other stuff in the description).\n\nokay the chapters were getting ridiculous they will now be in the captions",

        "description": "Taking advantage of boosts in rocket league to play Bad Apple!! with lineart :D\n\nFor anyone wondering, here are some answers to frequently asked questions: \n\nQ: How did you do this? \nA: Here is an in-depth explanation of what I did to render Bad Apple!! in Rocket League:\n\nI first applied what is called a \"kernel\", or a convolution matrix, on every image of the video. You can learn more about kernels on wikipedia if you're interested: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)\nI applied specifically the \"ridge detection\" one. \nThe problem with this specific kernel is that it removes the sun/moon at 1:48 and 1:55, for example. To prevent that, you need to clamp the brightness of pixels to a hard \"0\" or \"1\", and remove anything that's in-between (which is what I did, hence the sun/moon is displayed :D).\n\nNow that the kernel is applied, we are left with a set of points that correspond to the edges of the image. The problem now is that if we were to use them to play the video right now, we wouldn't know in which order to do so. The cars would jump from one part of the image to the other, without any order in mind, and we wouldn't be able to recognize anything at all. \nAnd so, we need to order the points that we computed with the kernel. \n\nTo sort the points, I used a somewhat greedy approach: \n- Take a point, and find its closest neighbor. Mark this neighbor as \"ordered\". \n- Take the found neighbor, and find its own neighbor. Mark this new neighbor as \"ordered\" too. \n- Repeat this until every point is marked as \"ordered\". \n\nThe problem with this algorithm is that you end up with a lot more travel than you need when rendering the image. For example, if you look at 0:32, you can see that the cars travel from the castle to Marisa every single frame. There are better algorithms that sort the points such that this travel is minimized, but I didn't want to bother too much and find the optimal solution. \nI kept the sub-optimal and greedy approach in the end because I thought it was good enough. \n\nFinally, once this sort is executed, we can start to make a bot that follows the path in the game! \nI won't go into too much detail for the bot part, because I think it's much simpler to implement than the image processing. \nI used what is called the RLBot framework to alter the physics of the game. With the framework, you can set the position of cars in the game at every frame (~120 fps). This is called \"state setting\". I used exactly 10 bots because the game wouldn't display the boost trails properly if there were any more cars. \n\nI coded the image processing part in python, and the bot was coded with the Java version of the RLBot framework. \n\nTL;DR \nApply some image processing to the original video to transform it into usable paths for the cars, and use the RLBot framework to override the physics. \n\nQ: How long did it take? \nA: It took me about 2 days to make this video.\nDay 1: build roughly the whole system, apply the image processing to the original video.\nDay 2: test the renderer, fix some bugs, tweak some parameters, render it, edit it, and send it.\n\nQ: Why is it ugly? There are something like 3 frames rendered at once.\nA: Well, it's not perfect. The boost I choose to render it has too much afterglow. It might have worked better with another boost, I didn't test everything. I thought it was good enough, so I stopped working on it and started rendering.",

Afterwards, i added all of the cards together and saved them. Each frame takes about 20 seconds to render with the optimizations i made, and with multithreading my computer chewed through them all in around 2.5 hours. Github is here: https://github.com/Spheroman/BadApplePkMn\n\ni then just ran it as a stop motion over https://pokegear.app/ made by Jake Gearhart as a background.\n\nthe song is a midi file played using the gbfont soundfont (https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/8).

        "title": "Bad Apple!! But it's a Geometry Dash level",
        "description": "ID: 67127924\nNONG Song: http://bit.ly/3gvtjow\nPress read more for info on how I made the level!\n\nOkay so I did this all in four hours (during online school but who cares), here's a quick rundown of how it all went:\n\nStep 1 - Download the Bad Apple!! music video, then use FFmpeg to extract all the frames from it. The video is nerfed down to a resolution of 50x38 pixels, and 30 frames per second (6572 frames total). 50x38 is important because it equals 1900 pixels total, which is just enough for GD's limit of 999 group IDs and 999 color IDs. It also takes up just enough space in the ship gamemode.\n\nStep 2 - Write a program to convert every frame to 0s and 1s, where 0=white and 1=black. Any pixel with a combined RGB value of more than 128*3 is considered white. Save every frame in a massive .json file (12 megabytes)\n\nStep 3 - Write another program to create a 50x38 canvas in Geometry Dash using pixel blocks. The first 950 pixels are colored black and assigned groups 1-950, and the last 950 are assigned color channels 1-950 (are all black by default). The pixels with group IDs can be individually toggled off to reveal a white pixel behind it. \n\nStep 4 - Create the 'base' GD level in the editor, while you're still able to open it without crashing. This basically means anything that I'm not using code for. The frame around the video, the background color, syncing with the audio, etc.\n\nStep 5 - Calculate how fast the player moves at 4x speed by recording a video and going frame by frame. You travel at 3.125 frames/tile at 60fps, which means 0.64 tiles/frame at 30 fps. 1 tile is 30 editor units, which means that a player at 4x speed is travelling at 19.2 units per frame. This means that we will update the pixels every 19.2 units (a little bit over half a grid space, 0.64 to be exact)\n\nStep 6 - Loop through every frame in the video and check for any pixels that change color. For each changed pixel, a color or toggle trigger (depending on which pixel) will be added to the level's code and flip the pixel from black to white or vice versa. Note that triggers are only added for pixels that CHANGE, because using 1900 triggers for every single frame is a recipe for disaster.\n\nStep 7 - Upload to the GD servers! At first I thought the level was too big to upload but turns out it was just because I had exclamation marks in the level title. So I removed them.\n\nmmm yeah that's about it, i had a lot of fun working on this. i'll probably update the level once or twice to fix sync or optimize it further, we'll see.\n\nOriginal Bad Apple: https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8\n\n----------------------------------------­----------------------------------------­-----------------\n\nSide note: There is actually another person who made Bad Apple in GD!!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxO3S_phfL8\n\nI was very aware of this video but wanted to try coding it myself. The main difference between our versions is that mine only uses legal values for group+color IDs (1-999) which means that the level is playable in 2.11 and also uploadable to the servers. However, this also means that my version has a much lower resolution.\n\n----------------------------------------­----------------------------------------­-----------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRealGDColon\nMain Channel: https://youtube.com/gdcolon",

The grayer the smaller the piece chosen is, with the smallest being the pawn!\n\nCool moments to check out:\n- 1:18 - Petals are white in the original, but aren't bright enough, so they're portrayed as changing black pieces instead\n- 1:48 - Fire!!\n- 1:57 - The sun creates a lot of in-between black and white pixels, making the piece gradient system really shine.\n- 3:18 - More petals and these look even better than the ones at 1:18 imo!\n- 3:55 - ;)\n\nThanks for watching!",

Will I make it through the night?\nWill there ever be a place for the broken in the light?\nAm I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?\nI've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?\nCan I take another step? I've done everything I can\nAll the people that I see I will never understand\nIf I find a way to change, if I step into the light\nThen I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to white\n\nEver on and on I continue circling\nWith nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony\nTill slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing\nAnd suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm\nSlipping through the cracks of a dark eternity\nWith nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony\nTo tell me who I am, who I was\nUncertainty enveloping my mind\nTill I can't break free, and\n\nMaybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real\nBut it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel\nSo I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside\nAnd I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night\nYou can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go\nBut I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know\nIf I make another move there'll be no more turning back\nBecause everything will change, and it all will fade to black\n\nIf I make another move, if I take another step\nThen it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me left\nIf I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night\nWill there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?\nCan you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?\nI've forgotten how to see; I've forgotten if I can\nIf I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back\n'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all would fade to black",

She was hiding from a  monster and following the shadows, but she didn't know that the monster was the reflection of her anger and guilt. When she accepted herself and stopped hiding, she could finally remember what happened to her on that day when she lost her old self.\n\nHere is the Full story of the Afton Family - https://www.quotev.com/story/11436648/The-Destroyed-Happiness\n\nSo as some may know, I have made straw poll about the next song to animate!

I am just waiting for some things to be done. Then I will continue it! (Hopefully it will be done this year)\n\nAnd yes, I know that there is no intro. YouTube started for some reason copyright my whole video because of it. So I will change the intro soon. (Hopefully)\n\nIf people are still going to complain about Face flexes, I won't care anymore.

It was created by ZUN for Touhou Project's \"Lotus Land Story\" game. It is sung by Nomico and was made popular by Shadow Art putting it to Anime-styled silhouettes.\nDue to being stressed over moving (of which I am in the middle of during this song's initial release) and finding it difficult to create said silhouettes as pixel art, Chase and I opted to go with a simple black and white backdrop and just let you enjoy the song.\nTune in next Friday for the start of my \"Twitch Sub's Choice\" of songs during the month of August!

        "description": "Кхем... Ну что я вам скажу - мою задумку с тем чтобы выложить карнавал танцующих секретов в день Хеллоуина мы все дружно запороли! Все молодцы, можем расходится 👏\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nНу а если серьезно то сейчас будет немного бомбежа, а потом я буду вас хвалить, ок?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nИтак... За эти два месяца которые вам были даны на то чтобы сделать 7-14 СЕКУНД анимации произошло много всего хорошего и плохого, но давайте сначала остановимся на том что ВАМ БЫЛО ДАНО ДВА МЕСЯЦА. ДВА. ЧЁРТОВЫХ. МЕСЯЦА. \nЯ конечно понимаю что все работают с разной скоростью, и ещё была школа, но давайте разбираться. Я учусь в специализированной художественной школе с 6 рабочими днями и 7 уроками в день, ехать мне туда на тримавае и плюс к домашка по основным предметам - два рисунка (живопись и графика) и около 7 набросков людей в неделю, а ещё в протяжении всей четверти нужно сделать композиции (Один большой рисунок акварелью, два или четыре по меньше акварелью и карандашом и скульптура из пластилина).\nНекоторые я конечно не делаю, не успеваю или ленюсь, но всё же это КОРОТКОЕ описание моего графика. И вот при всём этом я сделала сверить МАПа ( интро продолжительностью почти минуту и 5 частей)\nКаждый из вас взял по одной-двум частям, некоторые сделали быстро,  некоторые медленнее, но их сильно пинать не пришлось, а были те которых я писала и пинала, и всё же к поставленному дедлайна они успели, ну и ещё были те кто сдал часть за месяц, или несколько недель по тем или иным причинам. Эти люди молодцы, но ведь были и те которые: просто не отвечали, сдавали в самый последний момент когда я уже пишу им что завтра последний шанс сдать часть, и были те которые сделали часть только после дедлайна.\nПочему сдавать части после дедлайна не трудно догадаться, вы итак это знаете, поэтому давайте я расскажу вам о том почему плохо не отвечать автору МАПа, и как это помешало именно этому МАПу.\nИтак первая история (даих тут несколько): человек взял часть, а потом не отвечал на мои пинки и вопросы на счёт состояния части и в итоге об этом заволновался один милун и сделал эту часть \"на всякий случай\", Аля страховка и в итоге в этом МАПе вы увидели очень милого и сасного Даста. Была ещё одна похожая история, всё было почти так же человек не отвечал, я и милун-семпай заволновался и сделал часть с Гено, но потом ща пару дней до дедлайна прошлый владелец этой части такой хоба: \"Самолёт летел колёса тёрлися, вы не ждали нас - а мы припёрлися!\" и выложил часть. И поэтому вышло два Генадия. Ну а ещё был один забавный чел который написал мне что хочет часть, но не написал \"Андертейл жив!\" и я спросила у неё кодовые слова, а она не ответила, и потом спустя месяц она мне написала что хочет вернуть часть :/\nОкей, я бы конечно ещё кое что дописала, и добавила бы матов, но думаю уже пора перейти к более позитивной части хотя нет, дайте расскажу вам ещё одну историю:\nФлора страдала больше всех так как учится она со мной в одной школе (такая же ситуация и с Германом, но его я не трогала)\nФлора: *медленно делает часть*\nЯ: *советую работать чуть быстрее*\nФлора: *медленно делает часть*\nЯ: *советую работать чуть быстрее*\nФлора: *медленно делает часть*\nЯ: *советую работать чуть быстрее*\nЯ: *выпускаю часть с Паперджемом*\nФлора: Блин, это шедевр, а у меня гавно какое-то, я сдам часть обратно.\nЯ: *сжимаю её плеци до хруста* Нет, ска, ты сделаешь эту часть*\nФлора: Окей, окей :'0\nФлора: *медленно делает часть*\nЯ: *советую работать чуть быстрее*\nТелефон Флоры: *Ламается*\nНу и кароч в итоге когда отремонтированный телефон ей вернули прям перед дедлайном, она доделала часть за один вечер, и осталась в числе живых. \n\nЛадно, а теперь о хорошем, здесь я уже буду более конкретна в плане имён участников.\n\nДва первых человека которых я хочу похвалить это конечно же Яндере (Blackberry kun) и Герман (Ранее известен как Oshi, но сейчас он Lu)\nЭти двое беспокоились за этот МАП так же как и я, если не больше. Яндере постоянно пинала участников вместе со мной и делала дополнительные части, а Герман интенсивно делал части и в итоге забацал целых 4 части, и Яндере кстати тоже 4 части сделала, но с одной часть мы немного облажались и в итоге ещё один Гено стоит в конце. Эти двое постоянно поддерживали меня и помогали в протяжении всего МАПа, за что я им очень благодарна. Отблагодарить вас больше и душевное мне мешает лишь моё немногословен, но всё же я должна это сказать. ВЫ РЕБЯТА, ПРОСТО ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНЫ, ОГРМНЫЕ МОЛДЦЫ, И ПУСТЬ МДОХНЕТ ТОТ КТО СКАЖЕТ ПРО ВАС ХОТЬ ЧТО-ТО ПЛОХОЕ UWU\nРеспект вам короче~\nЯндере (Blackberry kun): https://youtu.be/AfYgo3TnnPM (скинуть ссылку на канал не удалось поэтому даю ссылку на последнее видео)\nГерман. У него вот как раз слетел аккаунт канала и он собирается начать всё сначала, это великолепный человек и аниматор поэтому подпишитесь на его канал \"Lu\" (ссылку на канал оставить не получается, а видео там ещё нет)\nhttps://youtu.be/OhCAzOXGiD4 - это ссылка на видео из старого канала, оцените качество анимации UwU\nЕщё раз скажу что вы прекрасны, обоих тискаю и уходу в закат OwQ\n\nДля т",

Hope you guys still enjoy!\nLink to mod: https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/14191\n\n\n\nSupport the developers!\nhttps://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin ‎\n‎\n‎ ‎\n‎\n‎\nChannel Info:\nThis channel consists of videos about modifications to a rhythmic video game (some of which I personally worked on) that range from slightly difficult to very hard for most players. Four arrows fly towards the screen forcing you to press them at the right time to the music. Hitting all the arrows in a song counts as a \"Full Combo\", which is very hard to do and takes a lot of time and practice to be able to do consistently and is the main gimmick of my channel, which I showcase in each video. I also include secrets and extra content that might’ve been undiscovered and show them off through instructional and entertaining ways that can be used as guides, as well as occasionally adding my own input on things happening in the video, all done through my creative editing style that focuses on being concise and transformative. In the descriptions I give my in-depth opinion on the video game as well as timestamps for each part of the video. All the videos were played, recorded and edited by me. #FridayNightFunkin #FNF #Flippy",

With Vocaloid beatboxing.\n\nMiku and Luka take the lead with Rin, Len, Gumi, Gakupo, and Kaito providing harmonies and instrumentals. This is actually a redo. I had a version of this up a long time ago but no... Just no. Never again. So I decided to make the full version and add some drum type thingies. (why not?) DOWNLOAD BELOW and answers to questions! Read before asking please :)\n\n*I own nothing but the video and vsq*\n*No copyright infringement intended. Plz don't sue*\n\n____________________________________________________\nUPDATE 12/4/14\nNever in a million years did I expect this to reach 100,000 views! Seriously I can't tell you how thankful I am for all the positive feedback I've received. ^_^ Thank you so much!\n\nUPDATE 6/7/14\n50,000 Views and over 1500 thumbs up. \n;_; I can't thank you all enough!\n____________________________________________________\n\nMP3: http://1drv.ms/1MsIwpb\nNico Nico Douga Mirror: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21466109\nMy Nico Mylist: http://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/38150894\n____________________________________________________\n\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: What is this I don't even...\nA: Vocaloid A cappella.\n\nQ: How'd you do this.\nA: Sleepless nights, back aches, tears... Sheet music helps :) The first version of this was taken straight from the sheets I had but for this full version I wrote a few parts myself.\n\nQ: How'd you make the beatbox?\nA: Gumi English. I just played around with the phonemes until I got a sound that I liked. Why English? More sounds. Why Gumi? Her inherent consonant choppiness made for a better drum set than Kaito or Luka.\n\nQ: I think you're lying. I hear cymbals!\nA: I discovered that by accident lol. It's really just a string of SHH,SHH,SHH,SHH. Seriously, every sound you hear in this video was made using VOCALOID.\n\nQ: How do video?\nA: The waveforms were done in Adobe After Effects. A few other minor editing things were done in Sony Vegas because my computer hates AAE with a burning passion. Actually my computer hates most things...\n\nQ: Can I use this for an AMV/dance/cover/etc...?\nA: Feel free! BUT PLEASE CREDIT. If you upload said thing somewhere please link back to this video. Also if you want, link me to your video. I want to see what you do :)\n\nQ: Can I has VSQ?\nA: No. Sorry, but you have no idea how much work was put into this ;_;\n\nQ: Can I upload this to other sites?\nA: No. It's already on NicoNicoDouga and just no to the other sites.\n\nQ: Meiko? Wut about Meiko? U no love Meiko?! WHERE'S MEIKOOOOOOO!?!?!?!111!!!\nA: I don't own Meiko....",

There are the first lines of the old pagan incantation written in Old High German in IX-X c. So who are those Idisi? There are some different versions: they are either Norns, weaving the thread of Fate, or Valkyries, goddesses, sylphs, wooden spirits, daughters of well-born konungs and glorious heroes. But most of the versions agree that Idisi (or Dises) were highly respected feminine deities who were in charge of changing the outcome of wars.\n\nOnce five maidens from the Lands of Russia came together, took their bagpipes and drums and started to weave the canvas from harmonies and rhymes. They called themselves Idisi in the memory of those mythical creatures. And they went mounted the stage and started to fight Silence in the uphill battle.\n\nAnd so... if you dearly doujin music enthusiasts want to listen to more arrangements of this kind from foreign artists such as song artist of this arrange, Idisi or from other non-Japanese arrangers from all over the world who are contributing to Touhou music community ever stronger than as usual, then of course it is important to show your support and reward their hard work by purchasing their works online！\n\nThe digital download of this instrumental folk album is available on a pay-what-you-like basis from Bandcamp.

        "description": "Bad Apple was quite popular around 7-8 years ago, and imo the reasons are :\n1. It's simply catchy\n2. It's an EDM (Everyone simply loves EDM, moreover it's melodious~)\n3. The lyrics are surprisingly deep.\n4. Well, Touhou fandom was huge back then. I Dunno how's it going right now as I actually know almost nothing about Touhou (I only know the general knowledge about it) xD \n\n============================\n\nI've known this song since 6 years ago, just got into it 2 years ago, and finally decided to work on it 3 weeks ago. Making a piano arrangement out of this is simply is the hardest hurdle I've ever because this song is very repetitive, yet there's next to none to transcribe because it isn't that suitable for piano, which is very challenging. In this situation, I need to rely completely on my arranging skills which means I need to try everything I can think of to make it sound less repetitive and choose which one is the best, thus taking me 3 weeks to complete.\n\nLike I've said on my post before, working on it gave me lots of anxiety and fear as I think there are lots of posibilites to tackle this song, and I was afraid of choosing the wrong \"Arrangement decision\" that will turn my arrangement into something shit. Thanks to my friends who helped me to decide which route sounds the best~\n\n1. Raindeca\n2. Unknown Dere\n3. StringTheoryViolin / Dixie Ortiz\n4. CSMPiano\n5. Sayuri \n6. My sister \n7. 1 IRL friend\n8. 1 online friend\n\nI couldn't finish this without you guys. Once again, thank you very much!!! :D\n\n============================\n\nBtw, besides mine and Marasy's, I think there exist another way to properly tackle this song.\n\nSHEET / 楽譜 : \nhttps://www.mymusicsheet.com/MyReminiscence/25213\n\nHave a nice weekend and happy listening :D \n\nOriginal Composer : ZUN\nOriginal Re-arranger : Masayoshi Minoshima\nOriginal Artist : Nomico\n\n============================\n\nMcm9N9Vg8VSXsIvsQ\nreminiscence/id1172422256\n\n\n\n#BadApple #Touhou #東方 #Synthesia #Piano #Nomico =\n\nListen and Follow me on Spotify : https://open.spotify.com/artist/7aebkMcm9N9Vg8VSXsIvsQ\nBuy my album on iTunes : https://music.apple.com/us/artist/myreminiscence/1172422256\nBe my Patron : https://www.patreon.com/MyReminiscence\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/MyRemiAp \nSubmit song request / recommendation : https://www.mymusicsheet.com/MyReminiscence?viewType=sheet-request",

Will I make it through the night?\nWill there ever be a place for the broken in the light?\nAm I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?\nI've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?\nCan I take another step? I've done everything I can\nAll the people that I see I will never understand\nIf I find a way to change, if I step into the light\nThen I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to white\n\nEver on and on I continue circling\nWith nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony\nTill slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing\nAnd suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm\nSlipping through the cracks of a dark eternity\nWith nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony\nTo tell me who I am, who I was\nUncertainty enveloping my mind\nTill I can't break free, and\nMaybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real\nBut it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel\nSo I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside\nAnd I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night\nYou can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to go\nBut I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know\nIf I make another move there'll be no more turning back\nBecause everything will change, and it all will fade to black\nIf I make another move, if I take another step\nThen it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me left\nIf I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night\nWill there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?\nCan you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?I've forgotten how to see; I've forgotten if I can\nIf I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back\n'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all would fade to black. \n\n-Requests?

        "description": "A little melody (slow version) of Bad Apple (the remix version) I made. It's a simple music box like version, where at times some lovely strings will build up the song a bit (actually a water flute, but has a string feeling to it). You can download and support at:\n\nhttps://flandre-sdm.bandcamp.com/track/bad-apple-sweet-melody\n\nDownload for free (just type 0.00), or donate to desire, whatever you want. Your like and listen alone means a lot, thanks!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/flandre-sdm\n\nFeel free to use this song in your videos, or covers as well, with credits to me. Have fun!\n\nScarlet background can be found at :\n\nhttp://otakumode.com/pchw/suki/touhou...\n\n (all credits to tsurukame for such a beautiful image)\n\nMy goodness, I did not expect this many views/likes. I really appreciate all the views and comments you are all coming up with. Keep them going, you are all amazing!\n\nIt has come to my attention that I have actually received a couple small kind donations and I appreciate it very much. Anything helps me. I am not exactly a high techy equipped person to make these stuff, and I'm hoping one day I can have em and pump this out at a more amazing rate plus all the other work I make.",

It took me so long for finish this because initially I planning to finish my another project along side with this and then until begin of March I came to realise I need far more time to do that project. \n\nI quit my job (after save some money) and try to focus on animation since October 2015, my plan during that time is complete 80% of the another project and show a teaser after \"Bad Sanvich\" credit. I was hoping I can finish on time but until this March it is not even 15% complete (i made a lot of progress, but still the project is too massive for one person....my ambition was too big), then i realise I not need any teaser for that because I was planning to give a surprise anyway so I start to finish \"Bad Sanvich\" as I dont want to let you guys wait anymore.\n\nI change focus on this project also because I almost spend almost all my savings (I only have half year saving though). Seeing that I was not able to upload any video despite working very hard on another project, and also I need to start working afterwards so I am unable to make progress for a period, I know I have to do something.\n\nSince I upload the first version of this video I didn't expect it can will be very much positive feedback, especially for 0.5v. I am very surprised I receive positive comments from time to time, and the video view is still growing (it might be slow compare to other channel, but I was expect the video will be dead few months after upload).\n\nLast and not least I am very very appreciate everyone who watched my previous video, liked it and hoping me to finish it, every time i receive your guys' comments it would made my day. Thanks everyone, your comments is my motivation and morale boost, I am able to finish this because all of your support :) Sorry though it could be finish on last year if I am not plan to do other project and thanks again for the waiting (it was two bad years for me) but hey, I finally finished this at last\n\nHope you guys can enjoy this finished animation and if you are new to this video, WELCOME! :)\n\nWell, its almost half years since I quit my actual job and spend most of my savings, now I have to start going to work and save money again. This means that I have no much extra time to make new video for quite some time :(\n\nthanks MaDaMax  for pointing out the original Bad Apple!! original characters are belong to ZUN / Shanghai Alice\n\nI also create a Patreon account, If you want to support me, you can go to https://www.patreon.com/CrimsonFlare?ty=h\n\nIt's ok if you don't have money to support me, you can share the video among your friend and social media, it helps a lot too XD\n\nWhoo...that is very long post, hope that you understand more on my current condition, if got anything to ask, feel free comment below, see you in the next video\n\nMore project are coming (not soon) :)",

THIS AGAIN? ...Yes. Sorry.\n\nWhen I find a game that really affects me, that needs to be honored, I get the undying need to profess my love for it in a way that makes me feel like a true fan. Some achieve this feeling by cosplaying. Some write fanfics. ...I make Bad Apple parodies. Deal with it. BD\n\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=VzEUeWnV73U\nParody of the gorgeous Touhou BAD APPLE!! animation, featuring characters from the Pokémon Black Version & White Version games (with a hint of B2 & W2 at the end).\n\n---\n\n\"Change your perspective -- and the reality changes.\"\n\n---\n\nAlternate title: \"Plasbad Apple!!\" ...Because it's bad for Team Plasma. Or Plasbad for short.\n\nBut really, \"Bad Pokéball!!\" makes sense because according to Plasma capturing is BAD, y'know? And yet, Pokéballs are the common thread that connects just about everyone in the video. They can't be THAT bad.\n\nShadeofDespair2468 first had the idea for this crossover, and generously let me borrow it. :3 Sorry this took so long, and thank you so much for always supporting me. http://youtube.com/shadeofdespair2468\n\nAnd...she and I weren't the only ones with the idea.\nhttp://nicovideo.jp/watch/sm15713851\n...Nnngh. ...I...wasn't first.\n\n*sigh* For a FAN-artist, a PARODY-person who dwells in DERIVATIVES, I've come to realize that I have an incredibly unjustified UNIQUENESS complex. Always, my worst fear is that something I really really want to do will be done by someone else first. And it happened. And it was already really GOOD... although its goodness is NOT the reason I feel uncomfortable posting mine now. Being better or worse never mattered; it's just that in everything I do I want to feel like I'm doing it for a greater purpose. Like I'm adding something worthwhile to a fandom's collective body of work. Doing something that's already been done makes me feel like a poser... Regardless, by the time I saw it I was already far too invested to not finish my own. I changed NOTHING in my plans after seeing it, so please don't try to say I copied anything or you'll make me feel really bad. ;_;\n\nI've been working on this project for the past two years on and off, for the past two months //day and night//. Lots of procrastination BUT ALSO LOTS OF HARD EFFORT later, here it is.\n\n...So I hope all the little nudges and details in there that make mine unique get noticed...\n\nDo you like how everyone up to N's point in the video is holding a Pokéball -- but N, the only one who truly believes in liberation, shows his empty hands?\n\nDo you like how 'N' is also cast as the one whose image shifts from white-on-black to black-on-white: fighting for ideals in Black Version, for truth in White?\n\nDo you like how when the ground-type and flying-type leaders meet, they end up -- as the lyrics say -- seeing each other's point of view (Clay taller, Skyla lower to the ground)? Incidentally, Kanako and Suwako, the characters featured in this scene in the original video, are indeed associated with the earth and the sky (though switched).\n\nDo you like how the normal-type leader and the one destined to become a normal-type leader strike the same pose?\n\n...Do you like how Zorua's tail twirls when it turns around -- askdj, I think it's cute. That verse is also my favorite because it talks about illusion & reality, themes common to Zorua/N and to Touhou.\n\n---\n\nPlaylist of all my \"Bad Apple!!\" parodies ~ http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWTg2MMrJQSr2TtZneDC1N6XYNHwKZ3BG\n\nAs you see, I am determined to improve with each one. The result: 1,300+ frames from Paint.NET to Windows Movie Maker. I lost count of how many times it crashed on me. But it was worth it for the smoothest, most legit, CONSTANT-MOTION animation I've ever done. ^^\n\n---\n\n~ CHARACTERS ~\n0:00 Hilbert\n0:15 Hilda\n0:29 Cheren\n0:36 Bianca\n0:43 Ghetsis\n0:50 N (...maybe)\n0:57 Fennel & Munna\n1:03 Professor Juniper\n1:11 Nurse Joy & Audino\n1:19 Emmet & Ingo\n1:25 Plasma Grunt ♀\n1:33 Anthea & Concordia\n1:39 Zorua\n1:45 young N\n1:52 Tepig, Oshawott, Snivy\n1:59 Chili, Cilan, Cress, Lenora\n2:05 Plasma Grunt ♂ & alas, poor Dragonite\n2:07 Burgh & Sewaddle\n2:11 Elesa\n2:14 Clay & Skyla\n2:21 Brycen\n2:27 Iris & Drayden\n2:36 Shauntal\n2:41 Grimsley\n2:49 Caitlin & it's supposed to be a Poké Doll\n2:55 Marshal\n3:02 Cynthia\n3:09 Alder at Celestial Tower\n3:19 Reshiram & Zekrom \n3:34 Rosa\n3:36 Nate\n\n---\n\nGuitar karaoke: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eVPRP0CiLKI\n\nI have no ownership of the original music or characters depicted.\n\n\"Bad Apple!!\" arranged by Alstroemeria Records, original by ZUN.\n\nPokémon belong to ALL OF US... ♥\n\n...but the series is technically property of Game Freak.

I guess you could call it a Minecraft stop motion animation.\n\nMore information is available below! Read the full description :)\n\nNote block song (+ song download) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sf064dkVeY\n\n* There are 6585 frames in this video, it runs at 30 frames per second.\n* Each frame is 256x144 blocks. So, a single frame is made out of 36864 Minecraft blocks. And all of the frames combined are made out of 242,749,440 blocks. That's right, almost 243 million blocks were used to make this video.\n* I originally had plans to render and upload this in 4K resolution, but my computer is not able to handle it :(. So instead, here's a 4K picture for you ;) - http://i.imgur.com/u7j1xKW.png\nIf you zoom in, you'll be able to see the blocks clearly.\n* The audio is a little bit out of sync in a few parts, sorry!\n* The frames were created with the help of Spritecraft - http://www.diamondpants.com/spritecraft/\n* The note block song was created with the help of Note Block Studio - http://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs\n\n\nInfo about original:\n\nArrangement by Masayoshi Minoshima.

Vocal by Nomico.\n\nOriginal video: http://nicovideo.jp/watch/sm8628149\n———————————————————\nSocial:\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/NiceMarkMC\nGoogle+ - http://www.google.com/+NiceMarkMC\n———————————————————\nDonate - http://bit.ly/DonateNiceMarkMC\n\nMake sure to leave a rating & a comment!
